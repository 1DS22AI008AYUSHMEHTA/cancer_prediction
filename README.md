# üß† Cancer Prediction Model (Binary Classification using Random Forest)

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts the **presence or absence of cancer** based on user input or batch CSV file uploads. It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** for binary classification, trained on a health-related dataset.

## üöÄ Features

- **Manual Prediction**: Enter personal health parameters manually.
- **Batch Prediction**: Upload a CSV file with multiple records for prediction.
- **Downloadable Results**: Get predictions as downloadable CSV files.
- **Real-time UI**: Simple, responsive interface built using Streamlit.
- **Timestamped Logs**: Batch results saved automatically in the `artifacts/` folder.

## üîç Problem Statement

The goal is to predict whether a person is likely to have cancer (`1`) or not (`0`) based on risk factors like age, BMI, smoking, genetic history, etc.

This is a **binary classification problem** tackled using **Random Forest**, a robust ensemble learning method ideal for tabular data and interpretability.
